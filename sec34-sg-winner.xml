In this section, we prove that the Sprague-Grundy value of a position tells us 
whether it is an <m>\cN</m>-position or a <m>\cP</m>-position. 
We have seen some nice evidence that the Sprague-Grundy value is actually a
generalization of the nim value. Indeed,  our main result is analogous  
to  <xref ref="thm-nim" />: we are in an <m>\cN</m>-position if 
and only if the Sprague-Grundy value is nonzero.

<theorem xml:id="thm:-grundy">
<statement>
<p>
The <m>\cG</m> be any combinatorial game. The game position <m>X \in \cG</m> is
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
 a <m>\cP</m>-position  when <m>\g(X) = 0</m>,
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>
 an <m>\cN</m>-position  when <m>\g(X) \neq 0</m>.
			</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

Our proof is a streamlined form of the proof of  <xref ref="thm-nim" />. In that proof, 
we had an explicit formula for the nim sum, rather than a recursive definition that uses 
the values of the followers. Starting with that formula, we had to understand the behavior
 of the nim value, compared to the nim value of the followers.
The recursive definition for the Sprague-Grundy value makes our general argument a breeze.

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>\cA = \{ X \in \cG  \mid g(X)=0 \}</m> and <m>\cB = \{ Y \in \cG \mid g(X) \neq 0 \}</m>. 
If <m>X \in \cA</m>, then no follower of <m>X</m> is in <m>\cA</m> 
(because otherwise <m>g(X) \neq 0</m>). In other words, every follower of
 <m>X</m>  is in <m>\cB</m>. Meanwhile, if <m>Y \in \cB</m> then <m>g(Y) \neq 0</m>. 
 This means that there is at least one follower of <m>Y</m> that is in <m>\cA</m>. 
 By  <xref ref="thm-NP" />, <m>\cA</m> is the set of <m>\cP</m>-positions and <m>\cB</m> is the set of <m>\cN</m>-positions.


</p>
</proof>

In the next section, we will finally show that the nim value of a Nim position 
is identical to its Sprague-Grundy value. In other words, the Sprague-Grundy 
value is truly a generalization of the Nim value.
