<p>We make one comment about the above proof. We do successfully prove that the sequence must repeat after a certain point, but our proof does not claim to find the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">first</em> heap size where the Sprague-Grundy values start to repeat.  We also don't learn much about the actual period of the sequence. The problem: we blindly chose to look at the sequence in huge blocks, regardless of the actually behavior of the sequence. In a sense, we are considering a "worst case scenario," so all we learn is that the period is at most \(M-N= s_k(j-i).\) We can get an upper bound on \(j-i\) using the Pigeonhole Principle, which says that \(j-i \leq (k+1)^{s_k}\text{.}\) Our resulting bound on the period of the Sprague-Grundy values is \(s_k (k+1)^{s_k}\text{,}\) which can be very large indeed.</p>
