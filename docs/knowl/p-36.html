<p>Now that we have these two different ways to refer to players, let us look at the example play of Nimble shown in  <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-nimbleplay.html" title="Figure 1.2.5">FigureÂ 1.2.5</a>. In this figure, we also describe the position as a <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">multiset</em> (a set where elements can repeat) where we list the locations of the coins in brackets. This more compact notation will be quite useful.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The game starts with three coins on square 3, represented by the multiset \(\{3,3,3\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Alice goes first in this game, so she starts as player \(\cN\) and Bob starts as player \(\cP\text{.}\) Alice moves one coin to square 1. The game position is now \(\{1,3,3\}\text{.}\) Bob becomes player \(\cN\) (because now it is his turn) and Alice becomes player \(\cP\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Bob sees that he can set up a Tweedledum-Tweedledee position by moving the coin at square 1 off of the board. The game position is now \(\{3,3\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Now Alice is player \(\cN\) again. She realizes that she will lose the game no matter what. She removes one coin from the board. The game position is now \(\{3\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Bob becomes player \(\cN\text{.}\) He copies her move. This brings us to the final (empty) board \(\emptyset\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Alice is player \(\cN\) and there are no valid moves. Therefore, Bob is the winner.</p></li>
