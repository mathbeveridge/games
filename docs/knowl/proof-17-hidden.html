<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Assume for the sake of contradiction that \(G\) contains vertices \(x,y\) connected by 3 edge-disjoint paths. Let \(H\) be the graph obtained by merging the vertices \(x\) and \(y\) into a  single vertex \(z\text{.}\) We must have \(g(H) \neq g(G)\) because \(G\) is the minimal criminal. Therefore the sum of games \(G \oplus H\) is an \(\cN\)-position.</p>
<p>Since \(G \oplus H\) is an \(\cN\)-position, Left must have a winning move. When Left hacks an edge in \(G\) (or \(H\)), Right responds by hacking the corresponding edge in \(H\) (or \(G\)). Call the resulting graphs \(G'\) and \(H'\text{.}\) Both graphs have \(m-1\) edges, so the fusion principle applies to each of them. The vertices \(x,y\) are still in a cycle in \(G'\) since we can only destroy one of the three edge-disjoint paths between them. So we can fuse \(x\) and \(y\) without changing the Sprague-Grundy value of \(G'\text{.}\) This fusion results in the graph \(H'\text{,}\) so</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\g(G' \oplus H') = \g(G') \oplus \g(H') = \g(H') \oplus \g(H') = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In other words, \(G' \oplus H'\) is a \(\cP\)-position. No matter what move Left make, Right can make a counter-move to put the game in a \(\cP\)-position. This contradicts the fact that \(G \oplus H\) is an \(\cN\)-position. Therefore, no vertices \(x,y\) can be connected by 3 edge-disjoint paths. \(\quad \Box\)</p></article></body>
