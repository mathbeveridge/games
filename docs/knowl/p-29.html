<p>This excludes games like Mancala and Go, where you accumulate points until the end of the game. Finally, it is crucial to note what else is omitted in this definition.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>No random moves such as the rolling of dice or the dealing of cards are allowed. This rules out games like Backgammon, Poker and Monopoly.</p></li>
<li><p>A combinatorial game is a game of perfect information: hidden information and simultaneous moves are not allowed. This rules out Battleship, Poker and Rock-Paper-Scissors.</p></li>
<li><p>No draws  are possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">When analyzing a combinatorial game, it is useful to give names to the players. You might be tempted to call them "the first player" and "the second player." Or perhaps you might choose "Player 1" and "Player 2." However, during gameplay this becomes confusing. As we alternate moves, these numbers no longer correspond to which player is active for the current move. (That is, after Player 1's  first move, Player 2 becomes the  first player for the new position.)</p>
