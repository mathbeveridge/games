<p>Our second variant of Nim is called <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Northcott's Game</dfn>. This game is played on a standard \(8 \times 8\) checkerboard. Each row of the checkerboard contains one Blue checker and one Red checker. The bLue checker must be to the left of the Red checker, but other than that, the checkers can be anywhere on that row. On her move, Left is allowed to slide one of her Blue checkers in its row (left or right), but she is not allowed to jump over the Red checker in that row. The checker must remain in the row that it started in, and cannot move off the board. Right is allowed to slide his Red checkers, again with no jumping. The winner is the player to make the last move.</p>
