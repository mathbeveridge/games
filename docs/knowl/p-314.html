<p><a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-lumberjack.html" title="Figure 4.2.1">Figure 4.2.1</a> shows a game position of Lumberjack with three rooted trees. The root vertex of each tree lies on the dashed ground. Note that the middle tree in this position is more of a bush than a tree, since it does not have a single "trunk" leading up from its root. Clearly, this position of Lumberjack is just the sum of the games played on the individual trees of the forest. By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-sg.html" title="Theorem 3.5.1">Theorem 3.5.1</a>, the Sprague-Grundy value of this game is just the nim sum of the Sprague Grundy values of the three trees:</p>
<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\g(G_1 \oplus G_2 \oplus G_3) = \g(G_1) \oplus \g(G_2) \oplus g(G_3).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The rightmost tree in this forest is a bamboo stalk, so it is equivalent to the nim heap \(*4\text{.}\) What about the other two trees? As always, we could find the Sprague-Grundy value the hard way: recursively find the values of all the followers and then take the mex of those values. You can imagine how tedious this process would be: the leftmost tree has seven followers and the middle tree has nine followers. In this section, we will describe the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">Tuft Principle</em> which gives a much quicker way to calculate the Sprague-Grundy value of rooted trees. The Tuft Principle is, in fact, a variation of <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-sg.html" title="Theorem 3.5.1">Theorem 3.5.1</a> about the sum of games.</p>
