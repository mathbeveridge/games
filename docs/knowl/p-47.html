<p>Our first observation is that any game position is either an \(\cN\)-position or a \(\cP\)-position. There is no ambiguity about who the winner should be, assuming optimal play.  Indeed, there  is no randomness in a combinatorial game, so a player cannot be defeated by bad luck. Also, there is no hidden information, so the player cannot be foiled by a lack of understanding of the current state of the game. Just like tic-tac-toe, a combinatorial game can be mastered. Ultimately, the fun of a combinatorial game is the process of discovering the optimal strategy.</p>
