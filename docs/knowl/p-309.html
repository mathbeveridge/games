<p>The game of <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">Lumberjack</dfn> is a generalization of Bamboo Stalks. Once again, we have the ground, denoted by a dashed line. We then have a collection of trees (acyclic graphs) planted on the ground. The grounded vertex is special, and we call this vertex the <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">root</dfn> of the tree. Therefore, we are playing on a <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">rooted forest</dfn>, in which every tree has a root. A move consists of picking a tree and then hacking off one edge. We remove the edge, as well as the branch of the tree that is no longer connected to the ground (or equivalently: no longer connected to the root of the tree). Once again, the last person to move wins.</p>
