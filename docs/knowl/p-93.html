<p>So who wins at Nim?  As a warm-up, consider a Nim game with one heap of \(n\) beans. This game is clearly an \(\cN\)-position, since the Next player can simply remove all of the beans. In fact, this is the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">only</em> move that guarantees a win. If we leave any beans behind, our opponent can immediately take them all to win the game. Two-heap Nim is also easy to resolve: we leave it as an exercise that \(\{ n, m \}\) is an \(\cN\)-position precisely when \(n \neq m\text{.}\) Three-heap Nim is more complicated, so we are best served by moving directly to the \(k\)-heap case.</p>
