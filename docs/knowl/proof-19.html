<p>Let \(C\) be a cycle through the root vertex \(x\text{.}\) Let \(y \in V(C)\text{.}\) By Claim 2, there are exactly two  paths from \(y\) to \(x\text{:}\)  the clockwise and counterclockwise paths along the cycle \(C\text{.}\) Suppose that \(G\) contained another cycle \(C'\) through the root vertex \(x\text{.}\) The cycles \(C\) and \(C'\) cannot intersect at any other points. Indeed, if \(x \neq z \in V(C) \cap V(C')\) then there would be three edge-disjoint paths between \(x\) and \(z\text{,}\) contradicting Claim 2. Furthermore, any path between \(C\) and \(C'\) must go through \(x\) for the same reason. Therefore, we can view \(G\) as the sum of two smaller graphs. The fusion principle would apply to each of these smaller graphs, a contradiction. Therefore, \(G\) contains exactly one vertex through the root vertex.  \(\quad \Box\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="hack-fusion.html#proof-19">in-context</a></span>
