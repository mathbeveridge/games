<p>We frequently we have put together smaller combinatorial games to make bigger games. For example, we created multi-heap Nim by playing with multiple heaps simultaneously (although we can only move in one heap at a time). We make this idea more formal in this section, and refer to this construction as the <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">sum of games</em>. The main goal of this section is to prove the Sprague-Grundy Theorem, which shows how to find the Sprague-Grundy value of the sum of games. Once we have this result in hand, we can finally show that the nim sum of the pile sizes in Nim is truly equal to the Sprague-Grundy value of the game.</p>
