<p>This brings us to the reindeer, which is obviously more complicated. The only new move of note is that we should immediately merge the two grounded hoofs since the ground (dashed line) is really one large vertex. Beyond that, we alternately apply the Tuft, Fusion, and Loop Principles. In  <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-reindeer.html" title="Figure 4.4.6">FigureÂ 4.4.6</a>, we immediately replace loops with twigs when we apply the Fusion Principle. Our transformation of the reindeer requires patience, as we alternately fuse vertices and use the Tuft principle to simplify tree-like branches. Ultimately, we find that \(\g(G_2)=5\text{.}\)</p>
