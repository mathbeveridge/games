In the first two chapters, we cracked the game of Nim: 
the nim value of a Nim position determines the winner.  
However, Nim is not the only game in town. The goal of this chapter is to 
introduce a broader framework that applies to all impartial combinatorial games. 
Our investigation will culminate in the <em>Sprague-Grundy value</em> of a game position.
